Submission for the first 'major' assignment in TOP foundations course.

Happy with the result, hoever it's clear there is a lot |I can improve on, proper alignment and sizing will take more planning on my part in the future as a lot of the css is patched together to fix things being slightly out of position.

Alot of it is also repeated and better HTML and CSS structure could drastically reduce the amount of coed written, will have to oook into creating utility and helper classes rather than adding a different class to each HTML element.

On reflection much of it could be improved just from better planning and laying out the website in normal language first so I can see what will be the same and how things will relate to each other.

For the life of me I cannot work out why the links to unsplash and the photography credit enlarge on hover.
